# Estimating-Population-Size-of-New-Jersey-with-R

The Unites States collects and analyzes demographic data from the U.S. population. The U.S. Census Bureau provides annual estimates of the population size of each U.S. state and region. Many important decisions are made using the estimated population dynamics, including the investments in new infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals; establishing mew job training centers; opening or closing schools and senior centers; and adjusting the emergency services to the size and characteristics of the demographics of metropolitan and other areas, states, or the country. The census data and estimates are publicly available on the U.S. census website. Data analysts use a verity of tools to create models for predictions, including models of population dynamics of a state or region. 

For this project, you will use R to create a linear regression model of the population dynamics of your state and predict dynamics of a state of a region.

The goal is to demonstrate your skill sets with R to support the various stages of the data analytics process.

A.	Create a linear regression with R to predict the size of the population for the state you live in based on the ‘Current Estimates Data’ dataset. Provide a screenshot of your results.

B.	Explain how you prepare the data from part A and how the dataset was imported into R, including screenshots of your results.

C.	Create an R script that will tabulate a statistical description of the model using R’s summary () function and provide a screenshot of your results.

D.	Predict the population size of your state in five years using a linear regression from Part A and provide a screenshot of your results.

E.	Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.

F.	Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.
